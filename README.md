**Additional Analysis** <br>

It would be beneficial to run precipitation for both June and December.  We would query "Measurement.prcp" by month in the same fashion that we did temperature.  

### Conclusion
While there are days of low temperatures (and high precipitation), the average temperature is very palatable.  Additionally, the third quartile is 77 degrees in June and 74 degrees in December.  As far as weather is concerned, the surf & ice cream shop is an excellent investment for the island of Oahu.  Of course, you may want to consider shave ice!
